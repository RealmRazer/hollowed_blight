Night has come to [[Blackport]], and with it came the [[Fiends]]. [[Horlstock's Gate]] has been breached by a [[Fiends|monster]] of old age and power, all while the city stays eerily silent. Seeing to their tasks at the end of the day, the #players respond to the new threat, each seeking their own priorities. Time marches forward.
