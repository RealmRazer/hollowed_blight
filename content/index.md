The night comes like any other. Soot and sand paint the onyx walls of [[Blackport]] as a storm blows through; the streets are no less busy for the weather. Patrons of the nightlife make their revelry known before many are to set foot through [[The Ash]], either on a merchant's voyage or other expedition, to [[Baroux]]. Along side them are adventures there to test their mettle in the wilds, and pilgrims, faithful of [[Numera]], there to walk the path to the lands of the faithful.

Lights pass through the streets as the activities for the night come to their natural conclusion, a night like any other. As the sands whip their way through the alleys, the quakes begin. In the cacophony of the night, the bell tower rings, and silence falls on the streets of [[Blackport]].

This is where the city the #players find themselves.
