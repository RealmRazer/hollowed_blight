title: Hollowed Blight
---
Blackport is one of the few safe havens at the edge of The Ash, a bastion before the hard and vicious trek east to Baroux. You lay down for rest in the night before a monstrous cry is heard. The town's waterways are broken, streets are flooding, and something knocks at the gates. You need to make your way out before it's too late.

Hollowed Blight is a campaign that takes place in `The Burning Wheel` system. Taking place on in [[Klei]], a world of burgeoning technology and controlled magic, players take on characters resting in [[Blackport]] on the night of a catastrophic event.
