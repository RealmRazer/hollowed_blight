Arriving at the Orc camp in [[The Ash]], the #players start to are pulled into different avenues, from investigating the ancient histories of the relic site the [[Orcs]] inhabit to fixing the goods that they are using for [[The Great Hunt]]. Underground, [[Connor|Thalion]] and [[Adam|Octavian]] unearth a historic meeting between Numera and small gathering of [[Elves]] and others sometime before the [[Calendar|New Light]]. In the interim, [[Trenton|Tyr]] attempts to make repairs on the camps equipment to get in the good graces of the camp while [[Blue|Jeremiah]] pursues the stockpiles.

With only old decrepit materials to use, the repair job is only half completed with and the spear refitted before [[Trenton|Tyr]] notices the armors falling apart. The [[Orcs]] are alerted to the issue and bring up the idea of a greater debt repayment in place of the damaged army goods.

After delving deeper into the relic site and finding one of the Demonic Rune Stones, the expedition reclaims the stone and attempts to barter for its ownership against the [[Orc War Chief]]. The expedition is able to take the stone, but the leverage of their ship is claimed in the process.
