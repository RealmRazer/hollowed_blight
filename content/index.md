In a bid to leave [[Blackport]], [[Thomas|Cor Devlin]], without a domain, summons a Jinn to speed the Sand Skiff along it's path. The vessel is brought close to the hunting lands or [[Orcs]], well off the path set by the navigator and initially set upon by the party.

[[Trenton|Tyr]] bring the engine under control but the [[Arcanum]] used to fuel the craft is spent in the process, pursued by the hunter's band, the #party elects to speed the skiff down and confront the pursuers. The Orc band, led by the [[Orc War Chief|Orc War Chief]] descend on the party claiming they are disrupting [[The Great Hunt]].

In a bid of truce to prevent any issues from flaring up, [[Trenton|Tyr]] elects to work on the Orcs goods as a service and is offered some information on the destination of [[Pinity Ironmountain|Pinity]] as well. The expedition, now low on fuel and presented with a different path, are escorted back south and east to the War Camp.
