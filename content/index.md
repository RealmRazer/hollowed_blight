Blackport is one of the few safe havens at the edge of The Ash, a bastion before the hard and vicious trek east to Baroux. You lay down for rest in the night before a monstrous cry is heard. The town's waterways are broken, streets are flooding, and something knocks at the gates. You need to make your way out before it's too late.
