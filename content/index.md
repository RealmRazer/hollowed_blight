Blackport is one of the few safe havens at the edge of The Ash, a bastion before the hard and vicious trek east to Baroux. You lay down for rest in the night before a monstrous cry is heard. The town's waterways are broken, streets are flooding, and something knocks at the gates. You need to make your way out before it's too late.

The night comes like any other. Soot and sand paint the onyx walls of Blackport as a harsh sandstorm blows through [[Blackport]]. While the weather could be better, the streets are no less busy, as patrons of nightlife make their revelry known before many are to set foot through [[The Ash]] on a merchant's voyage to [[Baroux]]. Along side them are adventures there to test their mettle in the wilds, and pilgrims, faithful or [[Numera]], there to walk the path and make their journey across the lands on their faithful trek.

Lights pass through the streets as the activities for the nights come to their natural conclusion, a night like any other. As the sands whip their way through the alleys, the quakes begin. In the cacophony of the night, the bell tower rings, and silence falls on the streets and [[Blackport]].
