# Description
A [[Demons|Demon]] from the first age who attempted to claim the sun and all that sat beneath it. The only information currently available are images and tales spun by [[Connor|Thalion]] during his songs.

After the construction of [[Pavlon]], the inhabitants set about trying to bind the demon in service of the city. They succeeded for a time, but the bound demon later broke out and destroyed the city and most of its inhabitants.
