# Description
A large burrowing beast from ancient history. Tet'ka was known in history to have destroyed a number of settlements and colonies before The Sundering Wars during [[Calendar|First Light]]. The beast was relentlessly hunted by [[Folk, Of Flagrant Dawn]] until it was recently sent low with the assistance of The Expedition.
