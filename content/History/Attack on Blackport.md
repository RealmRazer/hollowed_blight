# Synopsis
On the night of 23 Mutio, NL 223, [[Blackport]] was attacked by a coordinated group of [[Fiends]]. The fiends, pushed into the fortress spear headed by a large worm([[MÃ¶ju]]), scoured the town for a number of unknown articles leaving a wake of destruction behind.

Throughout the event, the #players spend the night attempting to check in on various members or the city, and also drive back what fiends they can.
