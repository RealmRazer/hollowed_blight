# Synopsis
After surviving [[Blackport]], the expedition into [[The Ash]] takes place in earnest. The #players set out in an imported [[Aboa|Aboan]] craft along with some supplies procured by [[Adam|Father Octavian]] and funding supplied by [[Trenton|Tyr Emeraldcrag]]. The first day into the journey however, spells immediate trouble, as a combination of spirit magic and outside interest bring the expedition into "The Hunt".
