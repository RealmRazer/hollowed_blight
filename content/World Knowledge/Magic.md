# Description
Magic is a gift in [[Klei]]. Those who are blessed with an aptitude for sorcery follow only one of a few routes: they are scouted and sent to the magic tower [[Anthioc|The Symposium]] in [[Trord]], go to study magic and its applications in [[Lantrik]], sequester away at home to practice smaller crafts away authoritative eyes as hedge mages, or they abandon the practice to live a simpler life.

Magic brings about a great power, bending the forces of the world with sorcery and other emotional magic. Human society and those who take part in it are "heavily encouraged" to register their names, and location of practice with [[Anthioc]], where they are also loosely monitored by nations they travel to. While a system is put into place to keep the public safe, the time and technology of [[Klei]] does not allow for a flawless practice. Incidents have arisen in the past lending to lowered sentiment and fear of those who practice sorcery. 

## Regulation and Control

## Faith
Similar to sorcery, there are those who are granted a divine revelation that manifests itself as a holy connection. Certain individuals posses the ability to bring about miracles or varying scales with strict adherence to the many gods of [[Klei]]. Those pious few are usually heavily affiliated with some chapter of a religious sect, and resources are diverted to make sure they are kept safe, nurtured, and closely watched throughout the realms.

## Magic of Mythical Stock
[[Humans]] and [[Roden]] practice sorcery and faith with a more strict adherence to the laws set in place to protect [[Klei]]. Other stock also posses an innate magic that is more difficult to manage. [[Anthioc|Anthoc's]] influence extends to most humans that reside in the many realms of [[Klei]], but the magic of other stock are harder to manage and control. [[Dwarves]], [[Elves]], and [[Orcs]] walk through and live in human cities often with less strict control from [[Anthioc|The Symposium]]. The innate magic qualities of other races are both interesting curiosities and dangerous unknowns.
