# Description
Magic is a gift in [[Klei]]. Those who are blessed with an aptitude for sorcery follow only one of a few routes: they are scouted and sent to the [[Anthioc|The Symposium]] in [[Trord]], study magic and its applications in [[Lantrik]] as scholars, abandon the practice to live simpler lives, or sequester away to practice smaller hidden crafts as hedge mages.

Magic brings about a great power, bending the forces of the world with sorcery and other emotional magics. Human society and those who take part in it are "heavily encouraged" to work with or at [[Anthioc]], where they are also loosely monitored. While monitors are dispatched to keep the public safe outside of [[Trord]], the time and technology of [[Klei]] does not allow for a flawless practice. Incidents have arisen in the past lending to lowered sentiment and fear of those who practice sorcery. 

## Regulation and Control
History has long proven that wizards, without oversight and control, lead to tragedy. In support of order across the realm, [[Anthioc]] was made a central institution to control of magic practices on [[Klei]] in NL 00. When children were found with an aptitude for magic, they were sent to [[Anthioc]] to control their power and the ethics and application of its practice. This series of teachings and checks have also extended to [[Roden]] who display magic aptitude in the fields. With time though, traditions of [[Anthioc]] have waned.

The practice and enforcement over magic is still controlled by the greater actors in [[Trord]], but the study of the arcane has broadened to other nations all well, like the Theocracy of [[Lantrik]].  Monitors are dispatched from [[Anthioc]] to keep track of known magic practitioners but also to search for any trouble that might appear in the future.

Not excluded from this tradition are the feats of magical stock. The songs of Elves, the  mythical craft of the Dwarves, the void call of the Orcs, or the spirit calls of the Great Wolves are of constant interest to [[Anthioc|The Symposium]]. Many races on [[Klei]] posses strong magical abilities that have been fostered in tight communities or practiced outside of the eyes of [[Trord]] and other cities on [[Klei]]. Those who move into the networked cities of [[Trord]] are under the scrutiny [[Anthioc|The Tower]], but many and more use their craft without venturing from their home lands.
## Faith
Similar to sorcery, there are those who are granted a divine revelation that manifests itself as a holy connection. Certain individuals posses the ability to bring about miracles or varying scales with strict adherence to the many gods of [[Klei]]. Those pious few are usually heavily affiliated with some chapter of a religious sect, and resources are diverted to make sure they are kept safe, nurtured, and closely watched throughout the realms.

## Magic of Mythical Stock
[[Humans]] and [[Roden]] practice sorcery and faith with a more strict adherence to the laws set in place to protect [[Klei]]. Other stock also posses an innate magic that is more difficult to manage. [[Anthioc|Anthoc's]] influence extends to most humans that reside in the many realms of [[Klei]], but the magic of other stock are harder to manage and control. [[Dwarves]], [[Elves]], and [[Orcs]] walk through and live in human cities often with less strict control from [[Anthioc|The Symposium]]. The innate magic qualities of other races are both interesting curiosities and dangerous unknowns.
