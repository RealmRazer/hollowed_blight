# Description
Born under the earth at the dawn of the world and destined to create the greatest works of craftsmanship of this age or any other, Dwarves are an ardent and strange people. On one hand, they possess an innate ability for crafting— their skills take on a magical nature when compared with those of [[Humans|Men]], [[Orcs]] and even [[Elves]]. On the other hand, Dwarven culture is a war between rigid tradition and fierce acquisitiveness.

Lying in the heart of every Dwarf is a terrible seed—one of avarice, lust and [[Magic|greed]]. It is a strange facet of their nature. Some Dwarves manage hold it in check, others give in to it—acquiring all they desire in a bloody swath of war, murder and betrayal.
