# Description
Born under the earth at the dawn of the world and destined to create the greatest works of craftsmanship of this age or any other, Dwarves are an ardent and strange people. On one hand, they possess an innate ability for craftingâ€” their skills take on a magical nature when compared with those of Men, Orcs and even Elves. On the other hand, Dwarven culture is a war between rigid tradition and fierce acquisitiveness.
