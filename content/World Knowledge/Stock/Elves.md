# Description
Elves are often perceived as either aloof and cold or out of touch and bizarre. Neither perception is true. Elves are a passionate people, keenly involved in the affairs of the [[Klei|world]]. However, their long view of matters gives them a unique perspective. What might seem urgent to short-lived Men and [[Dwarves]] is a matter that can be considered at length for the Elves. But once their interest is piqued or ire aroused, Elves engage intensely.

Nor are Elves above the common struggle. They are as complex and internecine as any other people. In fact, it is the mix of their need to be involved, their temperamental nature and their immortal being that gives rise to their [[Magic|Grief]]. Often their aged wisdom allows them to predict that their affairs will come to a tragic end, but their fiery nature grants them little latitude to stop the calamity. Watching and living this endless cycle of strife nurtures within them a great anguish, ever growing across their endless lives.
