# Description
Least common of all the stock on [[Klei]] are the Beastfolk; humanoid incarnations of the myriad animals, Beastfolk are a rare intermixing of both magic and sentience. No clear information is known about how they come into existence but they generally wander the planes alone carving out a living as diviner of the land, but have been known to join small communities of [[Roden]].

Though similar in animalistic qualities, and confused by those without knowledge, [[Roden]] differ from Beastfolk in their life and qualities. Beastfolk are an after effect of some magic gone awry. Beastfolk cannot repopulate and after their life is expanded, there is no guarantee such a creature will reappear. [[Roden]] are natural creature, with a society, culture, and natural order like [[Humans]], [[Elves]], [[Dwarves]], and other stock.

Legends say that being in the presence of Beastfolk can lead to either good luck or ill omens, this is exacerbated by the folklore around the form they assume; a blue jay may be a harbinger of fortune while a lycan seen in the night could spell disaster. In human settlements, seeing a Beastfolk is a wonder, and many would stake good coin to experience the sight.
