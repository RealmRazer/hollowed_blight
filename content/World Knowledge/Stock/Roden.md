# Description
All Field Roden are brought up with a great respect for [[Aecer]]. Piety is the greatest virtue, followed by humility and patience. Services are held weekly, and it is very embarrassing to miss one.

Those Below no longer have [[Magic|faith]]. What remain are bitterness, conspiracy and doubt, along with empty souls. They blame [[Aecer]] for their misery and wretched condition. Contrary to the beliefs of the Society, those Below blame her for committing them to a vision that they never had a chance of completing.

Often called Rat as a derogatory term.
