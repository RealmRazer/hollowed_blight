# Description
The Great Gatherer, Aecer, is the benevolent deity of the Field Roden. Through her grace and love, the fields are fertile, the children are strong and lives are peaceful. Aecer is the Lady of the Harvest and the Seasons. She maintains the proper cycles of day and night, planting and gathering, and birth and death.
All Field Roden are brought up with a great respect for Aecer. Piety is the greatest virtue, followed by humility and patience. Services are held weekly, and it is very embarrassing to miss one.

Those Below no longer have faith. What remain are bitterness, conspiracy and doubt, along with empty souls. They blame Aecer for their misery and wretched condition. Contrary to the beliefs of the Society, those Below blame her for committing them to a vision that they never had a chance of completing.
