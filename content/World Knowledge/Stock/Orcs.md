# Description
Twisted, tortured and fulgent with [[Magic|hate]], these cousins of the [[Elves]] exist in a culture that is a cruel mockery of civilization—one of fear and brutality, a society of the whip.

They know their plight. They mass in the caves and shadows, gathering strength, beating their war drums, summoning their fury in preparation for sweeping and sudden war—a slaughter in which they will take revenge upon those who dared taunt them with what they do not and will never have.

Like their [[Elves|Elven]] kin, Orcs are immortal—they are tied to the fate of the earth and will only die when it dies. They can be prematurely killed by violence or be driven over the brink of madness by their powerful, latent emotions.

Unlike their cousins, Orcs live under terrifying and brutal conditions—an Orc is far more likely to be killed by his kin than he is to die in battle against his true enemies.
