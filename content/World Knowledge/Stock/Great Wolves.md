# Description
In the deep wilderness, far beyond where the lesser wolf packs roam, hunt the Great Wolves. These massive creatures are the descendants of the first wolf, the most Ancient Great Grandfather.

The Great Wolvesâ€™ voracious appetites drive them to the fringes of the [[Klei|world]]. Even just a handful of Great Wolves require vast hunting ranges spanning hundreds of miles to feed their collective appetite. Such territoriality precludes being close neighbors with other large predators, namely humankind.

Great Wolves are not naturally hostile to [[humans]] or other creatures, but they are fierce competitors in the race for survival. In the wilds of the deep tundra and dark forests, life is always a struggle. The wolves will always do what they feel is necessary to overcome.

## Culture
Just like lesser wolves, Great Wolves have a complex social structure built around the family. A wolf pack consists of a family lead by a Dominant male and female pair, with their offspring from the past few years. Rarely do they allow outsiders into the pack.

Great Wolf packs are smaller than lesser wolf packs, containing perhaps three to six wolves. The Dominant wolves are generally the strongest and largest in the pack, but this is not always the case. Smaller, wiser wolves have been known to lead very successfully.
