# Description
Humans have settled across the far reaches of [[Klei]], forming many different cultures centers, cities, and kingdoms. The differences between cultures and individuals is as vast as the continents themselves. Ingenuity and adaptability have allowed humanity to flourish and carve out the landscapes and establish larger inter-continental travel than had note previously been known to the longer lived species of the [[Klei|realm]].

The interconnectivity of humans has made exchanges between the different stock more common than ever, and while many of the larger kingdoms are predominately human, the sight of [[Elves]], [[Dwarves]], [[Roden]], and even [[Orcs]] is not uncommon. Different racial traditions have enriched the human societies leading to a mutual benefit and advancement of human society, though nothing comes without tension.
