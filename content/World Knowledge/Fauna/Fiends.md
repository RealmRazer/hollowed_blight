# Description
Fiends are a diverse and dangerous category of creatures that hail from the darkest corners [[Klei]]. They come in myriad shapes, sizes, and forms, each possessing unique abilities and characteristics. Fiends come in a wide array of forms, ranging from monstrous beasts and grotesque aberrations to cunning tricksters and shadowy specters. Some fiends resemble creatures found in nature, while others defy categorization with their otherworldly appearances. From towering giants and ferocious beasts to insidious demons and malevolent spirits, fiends are as diverse as they are dangerous.

Encountering fiends is a perilous affair, as they are often encountered in the most inhospitable and dangerous environments. Whether lurking in the depths of ancient ruins, haunting the shadowy depths of dense forests, or prowling the desolate wastelands of [[The Ash]], fiends pose a constant threat to adventurers and travelers alike.
