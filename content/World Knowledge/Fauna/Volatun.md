# Description
Strange bird like creatures that appeared during the Attack on Blackport. Are known scavengers that prowl some corners of [[Klei]], eating what carrion and refuse they come across. With little in the way of defense, they instead opt for stealth and camouflage to aid them.

Volatun emit a very low song that breaks sound in the area around them, leaving only silence. The particulars of their actions, either magic or intricate vocal shifts isn't well known yet.
