# Description
A degraded shadow shrouded [[Fiends|fiend]] in the form of a wolf. The large creatures are known to be minor threats to those wandering the fields of [[Klei]], mostly due to the fact that they generally hunt alone.

These creatures generally stalk prey at night, but during lighter hours, are known to create their own darkened hunting grounds using the shadows that pour of of their mouths.
