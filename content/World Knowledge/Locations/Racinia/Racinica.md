# Description
Racinia is the western continent of [[Klei]], hosting a mix of cultures and trade across the reaches of its shores. The dominant kingdom of [[Pinem]] sits on its southern banks, contested in faith by the kingdom of [[blank]] to the north east. Between the two kingdoms, sits [[The Ash]], the marked wasteland of bone white soot and dirt.
