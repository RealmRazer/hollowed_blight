# Description
Trod is an independent continent to the east of [[Racinica]]. Located on a mostly arid and dry continent, Trod relies on trade to supplement for its more scare vegetation and food goods. The influx of trade and relative location to [[Maelbreak]] have led Trod to become a bastion of trade and intermediary for intercontinental trade on [[Klei]].
