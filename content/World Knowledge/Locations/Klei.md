# Descriptions
The world of Klei is diverse world of geological marvels, diverse cultures, and dangerous outlands. Civilizations have established themselves in the outreaches where [[Fiends]] either cannot tread or have been driven out of. Six main continents compose the world of Klei, each boasting different fauna, cultures, and challenges.

## [[Trord]]
A small continent to the east of [[Racinica]]. A long history of trade and establishment of the magic tower [[Anthioc]] have made Trord and its [[Free Ports of Trord|port city]] an important location for all of Klei.

## [[Aboa]]

## [[Otia]]
The small mountainous continent to the north of Aboa at the eastern reaches of Klei. Otia is a home to craftsman and a great exporter of mined ores and materials hard to obtain in other regions of Klei.

## [[Pramos]]
