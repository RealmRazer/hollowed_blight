# Description
An ancient city resting underneath the southeastern corners of [[The Ash]]. The city was constructed by a number of ancient [[Humans]], [[Dwarves]] , and [[Elves]] to create a large scale utopian city in the desert reaches.

The city was forced underground due to the harsh environments of [[The Ash]], but research into arcane crafting, enchantment, and spirit binding continued until a means to bind even greater demons was perfected. 

After centauries of using the binding technique, the city was [[The Fall of Pavlon|destroyed]] by the very demons used to fuel its innovations and ambitions.
