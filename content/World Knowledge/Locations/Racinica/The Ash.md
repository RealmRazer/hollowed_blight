# Description
The Ash is a barren land that stands at the eastern center of the continent of [[Racinica]]. Marked by its ash grey soot and sands, the region is a near inexplicable barrier between [[Pinem]] and [[Lantrik]]. The land is dotted with jagged mountains, shifting mounds, and sinks holes.

Though the land is entrenched in its bone white debris, it is not devoid of vegetation. Instead, the trees, grass, and other elements of flora have taken on a similar pale color to the surrounding lands.  

Travelers seek to cross The Ash for a variety of reasons. Following in the footsteps of [[content/World Knowledge/Divinity/Numera]], pilgrims seeks to walk the lands to [[Klei]]. Many of the order have taken to travel between [[Blackport]] and [[Baroux]] to enlightenment on the journey and worship at some of the local temples in the neighboring cities. Merchants may also seek to travel between the wastes between the two kingdoms if time or funds are strict.
