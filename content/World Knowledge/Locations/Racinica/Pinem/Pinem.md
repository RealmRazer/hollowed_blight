# Description

The southern kingdom on the continent of [[Racinica]]. Pinem is composed of a myriad different cultures, people, and goods, but the key distinction of its native people is a loyalty to the crown. The seat of power for Pinem is housed in [[Maelbreak]], which sits in the southern reaches and a small distance from the coast.

While largely sheltered by the natural mountains of [[Racinica]], trade is a large party of Pinem and its cities. Lack of access to the Ardent Ocean requires that trade ships and goods be ferried through the free ports of [[Trord]] on the small eastern continent.

Much of the kingdom's exports focus on agriculture and forestry due to it's abundant blossoming landscapes. The forests to the south also produce trees of reputable caliber, though any of such high quality are reserved for top bidders or projects of import.
