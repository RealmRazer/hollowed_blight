# Description
Maelbreak, the seat of power in [[Pinem]], sits in a hilled and crested region of southern Racinica. Its towering walls are constructed of sturdy stone, adorned with banners bearing the kingdom's sigil and flanked by imposing watchtowers.

_Architecture_: Cohesion is an important aspect of Maelbreak. While pop up markets and shops line the harbor on all hours of mornings and trading rushes, the established city districts are risen monuments to the stone work of dwarves who have taken city as a home over many years. Each district, though widespread, adheres to pattern schemes of colors and styled edifice to create a bonded community between the populace. Though districts all have their own distinction, no building is without the crest of the [[Pinem]] kingdom embossed to mark that none are not part of its reach.

_Layout_: Maelbreak sprawls in all directions, split into different disciplined centers from the maritime trade going through [[Trord]] and the ever present farming and logging from the woods and lands to the west.  Radiating outwards from the city center are winding streets and narrow alleys lined with bustling markets, quaint shops, and sturdy stone houses. The harbor, bustling with activity, serves as the lifeblood of Maelbreak, connecting the city to distant lands and fostering trade and commerce. Lying inland and to the western side of Maelbreak, sits [[Cathoras Castle]], the main seat of power for the city and Pinem as a whole.

_Atmosphere_: Maelbreak exudes a sense of maritime grandeur and rugged beauty. The salty sea breeze mingles with the scents of fish and saltwater, while the cries of seagulls echo overhead.
