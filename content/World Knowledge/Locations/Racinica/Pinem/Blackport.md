# Description
Blackport is a strategic medieval city located on the edge of the kingdom of [[Pinem]] on the continent of [[Racinica]], serving as both a military outpost and bastion trading hub at the western edges of [[The Ash]]. Its position makes it a crucial bastion against the unknown dangers that lie beyond, and its architecture and atmosphere reflect a city constantly prepared for defense and vigilance.

_Architecture_: The city of Blackport boasts tall, imposing walls made of dark stone that encircle the entire settlement. Guard towers loom at regular intervals along the walls, equipped with ballistae and archers, constantly scanning the horizon for any signs of danger. The buildings within the city are built with a mix of sturdy stone and timber, designed for both functionality and defense.

_Layout_: Blackport is divided into several districts. The central area houses the [[Obsidian Fortress]] and the barracks, where soldiers are trained and housed. Surrounding this are the markets and residential quarters, bustling with activity during the day.

_Surroundings_: Sitting at the edge of [[The Ash]], Blackport is a unique vista. The walls of the fort are stained white from the sands and soot from wasteland, but to west and south, the crests of nature are abundant. Verdant fields and the small forest glade to its south paint a more serene picture than the inside of the fort would tell.
