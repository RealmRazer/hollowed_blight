# Description
Numera The Pilgrim, was a traveler who walked the lands aiding the sick and downtrodden. During the tumultuous wars 223 years ago, she walked the lands and established a peaceable relationship between the kingdoms of Aboa. Additionally, she was known to bless the lands she walked, and relieve the threats of fiends who remained on the land.

Her divinity led to her disappearance years later that many attribute to ascension to the divine realms. Many other walk in her steps to hopefully being peace to the lands. Though contrary to what might have been her will, many churches and organizations have risen in her name.

## The First Order
During her time walking the lands of Klei, she was followed by a number of other travelers who would come to be known as her apostles. Seven travelers accompanied her on her journey through Klei and worked to both keep her safe and attend to the needs of the many.

Each of the apostles is named in the [[Calendar|Numeran Calendar]].

## Walking the Path
Many devoted to Numera now "Walk the Path" as a form of prayer. Opting to walk the lands, faithful try to bless the lands and people they meet, doing what they can to ease the suffering they find before them.

Pious though many are, many organizations have spread in the years after Numera's dissapearence, pining for what power and wealth could be bled from those who still remember her virtuous steps.
