# Description
Minor pantheons and deities spring up across [[Klei]] often. One of the more memorable fringe deities is Asdall, the Patron of Travelers and Discovery. Many peoples across [[Klei]] carry the clawed tome of Asdall during their travels, either as a simple heirloom or an actual token of worship.

Asdall is rumored to bless their patrons with chance encounters of new marvels and ancients secrets that make the god a wonderous story for merchants and mercenaries alike.
