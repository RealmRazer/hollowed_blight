# Description
A natural crystal mined from under the ground of various continents in [[Klei]]. Though previously sought after for it's swirling luster, later study in [[Aboa]] and [[Anthioc]] have lead to better insight into its use in practical magical applications.

Arcanum contains latent lines of natural magic that can be used to fuel the engines and arcane laboratories of scholars around the world. Recent discoveries have allowed some to create works of art and magic that rival some natural spell casters.
