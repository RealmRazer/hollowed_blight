# Description
Outside of evoked spell and the divine, spirits operate as intrinsic forces of the [[Klei]]'s will. The natural magics of the world, after a prolong period of time, coalesce and harbor their own wills. These bundles of consciousness are then, depending on the nature and power of the spirit, pull away from them mortal world into an altogether twisted plane of existence.

Spirits are broken down into different categories depending on their power and conceptual origin. The largest break down of spirits is into Greater Spirits and Minor Spirits.

## Greater Spirits
Greater Spirits manifest after long millennia of absorbing the magics of nature of the world. Acting as the upper echelon of spirits, they carry a sway over some of the broader concepts and aspects of [[Klei]].

In addition to the broader concepts Greater Spirits represent, they also impose a hierarchy on some minor spirits that are born from the world.

## Minor Spirits
Fledgling spirits are categorized as Minor Spirits, beings that have a blossoming power and control of smaller aspects of a larger domain.
