# Description
Similar to [[Fiends]], Demons encompass a collective category of threats that prey upon the beings of [[Klei]]. Unlike [[Fiends]] however, Demons are a genus reserved for an otherworldly or divine origin. Similar to [[Spirits]], demons are given their own categories and genealogy, though the specifics and rankings of Demons often fluctuate depending on the influence they can draw onto the world at a time.
