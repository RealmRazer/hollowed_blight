| - Tyr's workshop is in danger of getting attacked by the recent monsters invading Blackport. I must do my best to help protect the workshop (in extension my home) while in the shadows.<br><br>- Although Blackport had been my home for the past decade, this cold ruthless city makes me long for the warmth of my rat's nest. I must find a way to clear my name with the nest's bishop and return to my family.<br><br>- Cuckoo is friend. Cuckoo must be set free| -I keep my dagger close by at all times and take it out when I sense danger.<br><br>- I always keep a light foot around others. It's best if they don't see me coming.<br><br>- I always scout any new area I go to and identify any useful items I could take. |

# Background
