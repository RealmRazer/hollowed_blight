# Opener
The white sands of [[The Ash]] lies north of [[Blackport]], a scar that has long marked the delineation between [[Pinem]] and [[Lantrik]]. Deep in the reaches of that barren land, sleeps a fiend of great terror, working to make it's mark on the world.

While the Duke prepares for the longs meetings and engagements with Count Tamrin, finally, a group of wayward souls gather in the halls of the [[Obsidian Fortress]] to make sense of previous events. 

Songs of the past bring history to the forefront. Thalion's recitation weaves a tale of the grey land and an aberration at its core, long before the kingdoms of man had fully settled Racinica. Paired with chance sightings of fiends rushing stones and baubles into the great worm the night before, the party comes to a conclusion.

Jaggeth, great demon of eld, seeks a foothold in the world, and a reclamation of artifacts marks the beginning. Tyr, Paolo, Cor, and Jerimiah walk the districts to find the sources of what's been taken. All the while, Octavian and Thalion await formal dinner, hoping to keep domestic tensions from flaring.
