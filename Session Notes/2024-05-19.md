Blackport is one of the few safe havens at the edge of The Ash, a bastion before the hard and vicious trek east to Baroux. You lay down for rest in the night before a monstrous cry is heard. The town's waterways are broken, streets are flooding, and something knocks at the gates. You need to make your way out before it's too late.

The storm has subsided and morning finally comes for the #players. The [[Fiends]] attack the city have retreated and the [[Obsidian Fortress]] shines as a bastion of safety where many of the populace retreated.

Dawn breaks. [[Blackport]] stands. Scarred, but standing.
